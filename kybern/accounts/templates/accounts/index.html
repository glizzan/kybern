    <p class="text-justify">
        Kybern is a website which helps communities explore new, non-hierarchical forms of governance and manage
        their resources in collaborative ways.
    </p>

    <p class="text-justify mt-2">
        Most websites assume a hierarchical model of user governance.  Each person's posts, comments, content are theirs and 
        theirs alone, to do with as they please.  This works out well some of the time, but what about communities that don't 
        want a single all-powerful leader?  What about when consensus is important, or when community buy-in is necessary?  
        When systemic problems arise, like the spread of misinformation or harrassment?
