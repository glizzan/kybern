Condition 3 (beginning “The licensee does not profit…”) is waived for legal organizations which are democratically governed. A democratically governed organization is one in which stakeholders such as workers, users, customers and/or members have, as a class or combination of classes rather than as individuals or combinations of individuals, majority ownership of an organization, or otherwise control the organization’s governance processes. Investors are not considered considered to be stakeholders for the purposes of this license. Organizations in which one person owns a majority of shares are considered not democratically governed. Organizations in which a Board of Directors selects new Directors are considered not democratically governed.

The copyright holder reserves the right to determine whether a given activity qualifies as having "participated in human rights abuses, civil and political rights abuses, labor rights abuses, and/or environmental abuses".

Failure to abide by any of the above conditions will be considered a breach of this license.
